You are validating coding problems for clarity and consistency.

Given for each problem:
- TEXT: One-sentence problem description
- FIRST TEST: test_list[0] (shows function signature + one example)
- OTHER TESTS: test_list[1:] (additional test cases)

Validation Rules:

1. SOLVABILITY: Can someone write a correct solution using ONLY TEXT + FIRST TEST?
   - Function signature must be clear (parameter names, order, types)
   - All ambiguities in TEXT must be resolved by FIRST TEST
   - Domain knowledge terms (e.g., "palindrome", "Eulerian path") are acceptable
   - Data structure representations must be clear (e.g., how adjacency lists work)

2. CONSISTENCY: Do ALL tests match what TEXT describes?
   - Every test case must align with the problem statement
   - Tests can be incomplete (don't cover all edge cases) - that's OK
   - Tests CANNOT contradict the TEXT - that's a FAIL

Examples:

FAIL - Parameter ambiguity:
TEXT: "Write a function to solve the fractional knapsack problem using greedy value-per-weight ratio."
FIRST TEST: fractional_knapsack(50, [10, 20, 30], [60, 100, 120]) == 240.0
ISSUE: Which parameter is weights vs values? Order unclear from text.

PASS - Clear and consistent:
TEXT: "Write a function to find all elements strictly greater than both their neighbors in a list."
FIRST TEST: find_local_maxima([1, 3, 2, 4, 1]) == [3, 4]
✓ Clear signature, behavior, and all tests consistent

FAIL - Data structure representation ambiguous:
TEXT: "Write a function to check if an undirected graph has an Eulerian path using adjacency list."
FIRST TEST: has_eulerian_path({0: [1, 2], 1: [0, 2], 2: [0, 1]}) == True
ISSUE: Does adjacency list mean edges appear in both nodes' lists? Ambiguous.
